# 🤠 Herding Sneks for a Definite and Real Purpose

**Snek herding** is tough work, but it's honest work. As a young aspiring herder, you've moved out to your new home in sunny **insert_quippy_town_name_here**, to herd yourself some sneks, feed them some bugs, update your pythons, and grow and nurture them into wonderful, glorious Curly Bois.
